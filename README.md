## Description

**Towers**, also known as **Tower of Hanoi**, **Tower of Brahma**, or simply **pyramid puzzle**, is a puzzle involving three vertical rods and a set of different sized disks with holes through their centers. The disks are initially placed on one of the rods, with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest on top. The task is to transfer the entire stack to one of the other rods, subject to two rules: only individual disks may be moved, and no disk may be placed on a smaller disk.
